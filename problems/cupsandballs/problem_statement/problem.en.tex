\problemname{Cups and Balls}

Rasmus has challenged Hugo to a game with three cups numbered from 1 to 3 in a row and a ball.
The ball starts under the middle cup (cup 2), and Rasmus will then quickly swap the cups $N$ times.
Hugo must then guess under which cup the ball is located. After Hugo has guessed incorrectly 10 times
in a row, Rasmus has started to feel sorry for him and now wants to help him win a round. Hugo has
once again chosen a cup to guess, and Rasmus needs your help to determine which two different cups
should be swapped for Hugo to win.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains the integer $G$, the cup Hugo guessed.

The next line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100$), the number of times Rasmus swapped two cups.

The following $N$ lines each contain two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i < b_i \le 3$), the cups that swap places.

\section*{Output}
Print two integers $a,b$ ($1 \leq a,b \leq 3$, $a \neq b$), the cups that should be swapped for Hugo to win.

If there are multiple valid answers, any is accepted.

Note that you must swap two \textbf{different} cups.

\section*{Explanation of Samples}
In sample 1, the ball is under cup 1 after all the swaps. If Rasmus swaps cup 1 and 2, Hugo wins because he guessed on cup 2.

In sample 2, Hugo's guess is correct. Therefore, Rasmus must swap cup 1 and 3 so that Hugo's guess is still correct after the swap.
