\noindent

You are given a uniformly random permutation of the integers from $1$ to $N$.
You will process the permutation from left to right, and for each number
you can either discard it or append it to the end of one of
the arrays $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$. At the end, all the four arrays must
be increasing. If you make your choices optimally, what is the maximum
value of $|a|+|b|+|c|+|d|$? It is allowed for $a$, $b$, $c$ or $d$ to
be empty.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$),
the number of elements in the array.

The following line will contain $N$ integers, the permutation in question.


\section*{Output}
Print an integer: the largest possible value of $|a|+|b|+|c|+|d|$.


\section*{Points}
Your solution will be tested on several test case groups. To get the points for
a group, it must pass all the test cases in the group.

  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Point value} & \textbf{Constraints} \\ \hline
  $1$    & $6$        & $N \leq 30$ \\ \hline
  $2$    & $14$       & $N \leq 60$ \\ \hline
  $3$    & $15$       & $N \leq 300$ \\ \hline
  $4$    & $20$       & $N \leq 3000$ \\ \hline
  $5$    & $25$       & $N \leq 20000$ \\ \hline
  $6$    & $20$       & No additional constraints. \\ \hline

\section*{Explanation of sample 1}
The array [5 1 2 6 3 7 8 4] can divided into increasing arrays [5 6 7 8], [1 2 3 4], [] and [].

\section*{Explanation of sample 2}
It is impossible to create an increasing array of size 2. Therefore, each one has 1 element and the answer is
4.

\section*{Explanation of sample 3}
One possible optimal division of [7 8 10 5 2 1 9 4 3 6] is into [7 8 10], [5 9], [2 4 6] and [1 3].

Note that the samples were not randomly generated, but it is guaranteed that the secret testdata was generated
in such a manner that every permutation of size $N$ is equally likely.
