\noindent

Gustav's panda Ivar is in the middle of a flower field.
He knows that his best friend Mango loves flowers so he wants to give her a nice bouquet with one red, one green and one blue flower.
Ivar just filled his stomach with bamboo so he doesn't want to walk too far.
He's currently at the coordinate $(0,0)$ what's the shortest distance he has to walk in order to pick one flower of each color and return to $(0,0)$?

\section*{Input}
The first line will contain $N$ ($3 \leq N \leq 2\,000$), the number of flowers on the field.

The following $N$ lines each contain two integers $x$ and $y$ ($-10^9 \leq x,y \leq 10^9$) and one character $c$ indicating the color of the flower, R, G or B.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one flower of each color and that no two flowers have the same coordinates.

\section*{Output}
Output a single number, the shortest distance Ivar has to walk.
Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative difference from the judges' answer is less than $10^-5$.

\section*{Points}
Your solution will be tested on several test case groups. To get the points for
a group, it must pass all the test cases in the group.
