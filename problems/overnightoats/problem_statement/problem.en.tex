\problemname{Overnight Oats}

As the true porridge connoisseur she is, Julia has decided to start eating a new type of porridge --
overnight oats. During an $N$-day period, each evening she will either prepare a jar of overnight
oats, eat a jar of overnight oats, or do neither. However, since overnight oats are food, and food
can go bad, the oats can also expire. Each jar expires after $X$ days, and she must eat it before then.
Julia also needs to leave room in her stomach for all the other types of porridge she eats daily
(oat porridge, semolina porridge, rice porridge, etc.), so she can only eat one jar of
overnight oats per day. Julia wants to avoid any jar of overnight oats going bad. Is this possible?
